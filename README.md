# Codewars-Problems-Solutions


A personal collection of all my completed Codewars katas using c++

I'm still a beginner when it comes to writing c++ code, so if you observe any problems, technicalities, and upgradable syntaxes, pulling a request and doing so constructively would be highly appreciated and educational.

As of now, the only language version used is c++17 compiled in Clang 8.
